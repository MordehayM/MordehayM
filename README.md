# About Me

[![LinkedIn][linkedin-shield]][linkedin-url]
### Hi there, I am Mordehay ðŸ‘‹



I'm a student of M.Sc in Electrical Engineering at Bar Ilan University.
I'm passionate about signal processing combined with deep learning methods.


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on finding a way to tackle the source separation problem i.e. the cocktail party problem with advanced deep learning methods 
- âš¡ A wise saying: In response to someone who says you are zero, say there is no million without zero:)
