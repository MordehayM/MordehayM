## Hi there <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">, I am Mordehay



I'm a student of M.Sc in Electrical Engineering at Bar Ilan University.
I'm passionate about signal processing combined with deep learning methods.


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on finding a way to tackle the source separation problem i.e. the cocktail party problem with advanced deep learning methods 
- âš¡ A wise saying: In response to someone who says you are zero, say there is no million without zero:)
