### Hi there, I am Mordehay 👋

<!--
**MordehayM/MordehayM** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm a student of M.Sc. in Electrical Engineering at Bar Ilan University.
I'm passionate about signal processing combined with deep learning methods.


- 🔭 I’m currently working on finding a way to tackle the source separation problem i.e. the cocktail party problem with advanced deep learning methods 
- ⚡ A wise saying: In response to someone who says you are zero, say there is no million without zero:)
